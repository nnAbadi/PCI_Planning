# PCI_Planning
PCI Planning for Tehran Sites Using Binary Quadratic Programming

The problem formulation can be found in problem_formulation.pdf file. This file should be studied before checking out the code.

Some notes about objective function and different solving methods are in presentation.pptx.

In generate_test_data_and_calculate_power_matrix.ipynb notebook, we generate a power matrix for an example, and in pci_planning_cplex__binary_power_matrix__allocate_pci_to_site.ipynb, we solve the problem. The notebooks are fully commented.

Have fun ðŸ˜Š
